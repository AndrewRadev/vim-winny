DESCRIPTION                                                 *winny-description*

The aim of this plugin is to make winow management in vim easier, for example,
while it's easy to push a particular window to a border of the window, it's not
easy to move a window a only a bit in a direction, sometimes rotating windows
can solve the problem, but not always, as it doesn't accept to rotate a group
if a container in it is split. A second problem this plugin aims to solve is
that navigating more than a couple windows is not really efficient.

This plugin introduces the following functions.
 
ShowWindowNumbers()                                         *ShowWindowNumbers*

Will use popups to display an ascii art representation of the windows ids on
top of each of them

JumpWindow()                                                       *JumpWindow*

Will display the window numbrs uing ShowWindowNumbers and then wait for a key
to be pressed, when the key is pressed, it will try to move the focus to the
window with that id. Known limitation, it's not possible to reach an id > 9
this way.

SwapWindows([n])                                                  *SwapWindows*

If an id is provided, the buffers of the current window will be swapped with
the buffer of the window with that id, if no id is provided,
ShowWindowNumbers() will be called and then similarily to JumpWindow it will
wait for a key and try to swap the current buffer with the buffer of that
window. The focus will follow the buffer to the target window.


USAGE                                                             *winny-usage*

While you can use the provided functions directly, it's advised to map keys to
them, see the |winny-configuration| section.

INSTALLATION                                               *winny-installation*

Nothing special, use your favorite plugin manager to add `tshirtman/vim-winny`

e.g with vim-plug add:

Plug 'tshirtman/vim-winny'

to your plug-list.

CONFIGURATION                                             *winny-configuration*

plug functions are provided to make it easy to bind to your desired keys, a
suggested configuration (add to your vimrc or a plugin).

" replace the very pedestrian <c-w><c-w>
nnoremap <silent> <c-w><c-w> <Plug>WinnyJumpWindow

" <c-w>s is taken, but <c-w>m for move is convenient
nnoremap <silent> <c-w>m <Plug>WinnySwapWindows

" <c-w>t is available, but makes less sense, this mapping is less important

nnoremap <silent> <c-w>t <Plug>WinnyShowWindows
